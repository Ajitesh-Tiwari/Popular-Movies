Note - Add the API-KEY in the file - strings.xml (app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml)

##Project 1 Overview

Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, you’ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing. We will split the development of this app in two stages. First, let's talk about stage 1. In this stage you’ll build the core experience of your movies app.

###Your app will:
* Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
* Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
* The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
* Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
* original title
* movie poster image thumbnail
* A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
* user rating (called vote_average in the api)
* release date

###Why this Project?
To become an Android developer, you must know how to bring particular mobile experiences to life. Specifically, you need to know how to build clean and compelling user interfaces (UIs), fetch data from network services, and optimize the experience for various mobile devices. You will hone these fundamental skills in this project.
By building this app, you will demonstrate your understanding of the foundational elements of programming for Android. Your app will communicate with the Internet and provide a responsive and delightful user experience.
What Will I Learn After Stage 1?
You will fetch data from the Internet with theMovieDB API.
You will use adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views.
You will incorporate libraries to simplify the amount of code you need to write

##Project 2 Overview

Welcome back to Popular Movies! In this second and final stage, you’ll add additional functionality to the app you built in Stage 1.
* You’ll add more information to your movie details view:
* You’ll allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
* You’ll allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
* You’ll also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star). This is for a local movies collection that you will maintain and does not require an API request*.
* You’ll modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.
* Lastly, you’ll optimize your app experience for tablet.

Recall from Stage 1, you built a UI that presented the user with a grid of movie posters, allowed users to change sort order, and presented a screen with additional information on the movie selected by the user:
In Stage 2, you will go one step further and allow the user to view movie trailers, read reviews, and select favorites.
Lastly, you will take the entire end-to end-user interaction flow, including what you built in Stage 1, and optimize it to work on tablets.

##What Will I Learn After Stage 2?
You will build a fully featured application that looks and feels natural on the latest Android operating system (Lollipop, as of May 2015).
You will optimize the UI experience for both phones and tablets.
